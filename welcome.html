      <div class="instruction">
        <p>This is an instruction page for the Chrome extension <strong>OneClickPrompts</strong> that you have just
          installed. If you are seeing this page, it means that you have installed the extension for the first time or
          it may have appeared due to an update ‚Äì our apologies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Pinned Extension Button</h2>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> You should pin the extension button, or you won't be able to access menu.  To do this, click on your extension menu,
          which is this button near address bar right here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="/welcome-page-files/extension-management-button.png" alt="Extension Management Button">
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>(Your button may be a little bit different in different browsers. So I'm attaching next screenshot from
          other browser) then select <em>'Pin'</em> near the icon of this extension:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="/welcome-page-files/pin-extension.png" alt="Pin Extension">
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="instruction">
        <p>Once pinned, the extension UI button will be available constantly in your browser toolbar: when you click it
          (green arrow), you will see a menu where you can edit the text for all the buttons that you add:</p>
        <img src="/welcome-page-files/extension-ui-button-and-popup.png" alt="Extension UI">
        <p>In this UI, called "popup" you can fully control the extension and, at the bottom, import/export profiles.
          Don't forget to scroll (red arrow) down to access features. At the top you will see the profile management, so
          profile is like a lot of buttons that are saved under this name. Buttons and separators can be dragged to be
          reordered.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Site-Specific Activation</h2>
        <p>If you want the extension to work only on specific websites, please do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Right-click on the extension icon in the browser toolbar:
            <img src="/welcome-page-files/right-click-on-icon.png" alt="Right Click Extension">
          </li>
          <li>From the menu, select <em>'Manage extensions'</em>.
            <img src="/welcome-page-files/manage-extension.png" alt="Manage Extensions">
          </li>
          <li>Select the websites where you want the extension to be automatically enabled. Or just select all websites
            at once. Sometimes after the updates this option will be disabled, so this is a good troubleshooting step if
            extension is not activated</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="instruction">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> When updating the extension, Chrome may prompt for permission for the extension to
          access websites. If you click 'no', the extension may stop working.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Tips for using:</h2>

      <div class="instruction">
        <ul>
          <li>A few usage tips: Tailored instructions that you enter with this extension can improve answers and
            enhance your overall experience with chatbots.</li>
          <li>You don't have to use just emoji for buttons‚Äîa custom text may help when you have lots of prompts. Just type in the field where there is emoji input: text will become the button.</li>
          <li>The first button is the system's button and is meant for buttons to appear on a floating, resizable panel.</li>
          <li>Example: Grok does not always initiate a search, but for some questions, you might feel that the answer
            would be better if it tried to search the web for one.</li>
          <li>The O3 model sticks to short answers, but if you specify after your question that you want a theoretical
            explanation, a few examples, and one related concept, you might receive a much more detailed response.</li>
          <li>When correcting a text, a chatbot may get very creative and replace your slang or informal words with ones
            it thinks are correct. By providing specific instructions to the chatbot, you can avoid this.</li>
            <li>Remove all the example buttons that you will not use, this will make navigation across your buttons easier!</li>
            <li>In Popup, you can reset position of all floating windows if something goes wrong</li>
            <li>See Google‚Äôs <a href="https://www.gptaiflow.com/assets/files/2025-01-18-pdf-1-TechAI-Goolge-whitepaper_Prompt%20Engineering_v4-af36dcc7a49bb7269a58b1c9b89a8ae1.pdf">Prompt Engineering Whitepaper</a>. For example, repeating important instructions both before and after your specific prompt increases the likelihood that those instructions will be followed correctly.</li>
          <li>You can open this page later from the popup</li>

        <h2>Queue Functionality: Send Prompts Sequentially</h2>
        <div class="instruction">
          <p>
            OneClickPrompts now includes a powerful
            <strong>Queue</strong> feature, allowing you to send multiple
            prompts one after another with a set delay between them. This is
            perfect for example when you want AI to search for news and tell you updates every 2 hours.
          </p>
          <p><strong>How to use the Queue:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Open the Floating Panel:</strong> The queue controls are
              located in the floating panel. Click the 'üîº' button next to the
              prompt input area to open it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enable Queue Mode:</strong> In the floating panel, find
              the "Queue" section and toggle on "Enable Queue Mode".
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add Prompts to the Queue:</strong> Once enabled, any
              custom prompt button you click will be added to the queue instead
              of being sent immediately. You will see icons for queued prompts
              appear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Configure the Delay:</strong> Set the time delay (in
              minutes or seconds) between each prompt being sent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Control the Queue:</strong> Use the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Play), ‚è∏Ô∏è (Pause),
              and üîÑ (Reset) buttons to manage the queue.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong style="color: #c9a722">Important:</strong> Please ensure
            that using the queue feature to send prompts automatically does not
            violate the Terms of Service of the website you are using. You will
            be asked to confirm that you have permission from the website owner
            before using the feature for the first time.

        <h2>Cross-Chat Prompt Sharing: Reuse Prompts Anywhere</h2>
        <div class="instruction">
          <p>
            Work with multiple AI platforms? The new
            <strong>Cross-Chat Prompt Sharing</strong> module makes it easy to
            copy a prompt from one chat (like ChatGPT) and instantly paste it
            into another (like Claude or Gemini). Does not uses clipboard.
          </p>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>

              menu, expand the "Modules" section, and toggle on "Enable
              Cross-Chat Prompt Sharing".

              "Copy" and "Paste" buttons will appear. Type your prompt and click
              the "Copy Prompt" button.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>üì•Paste & Send:</strong> Switch to a different AI chat
              platform. Click the "Paste & Send Prompt" button to instantly
              transfer your text.
            </li>
